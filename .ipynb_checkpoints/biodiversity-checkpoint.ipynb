    "\n",
    "When starting a new project, it's a good idea to define its scope. Four parts have been designed to guide the project's development and progress. The first component is the project goals, which outline the project's high-level aims and purposes. The next component is the data; fortunately, data is already supplied in this project, but it must be determined whether the project goals can be satisfied with the data available. Third, the analysis must be well planned, including the methodologies and questions that will be used to achieve the project's objectives. Finally, evaluation will assist us in drawing conclusions and results from our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the perspective will be that of a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service. The National Parks Service seeks to secure the survival of at-risk species and sustain the amount of biodiversity in its parks. As a result, the primary goals of an analyst will be to understand the features of the species and their conservation status, as well as the species' link to national parks. Some questions are posed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of `conservation_status` for animals?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which species were spotted the most at each park?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project included two data sets with the package. The first `csv` file contains information about each species, while the second has observations of species and park locations. This data will be used to examine the project's goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques will be used to better comprehend the data. Statistical inference will also be applied to determine if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the major metrics that will be calculated are: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Counts\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. Relationship between Species\n",
    "1. `conservation_status` of Species\n",
    "1. Observations of Species in Parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is a good idea to read over the objectives again and see if the analysis output matches to the questions that were originally established to be addressed (in the goals section). This part will also reflect on what was discovered during the process and whether any of the questions could not be addressed. This might also include limits or if the analysis could have been conducted using alternate approaches."
